## Krayan GTK Theme

Krayan is a flat Material Design theme for GTK3, GTK2, and GNOME Shell based on the well aquitted [Layan GTK theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Layan-gtk-theme) by [Kevin D'souza](https://github.com/krypticallusion) and [Diab Neiroukh](https://github.com/lazerl0rd). This is the KDE version based on [Layan's KDE theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/layan-kde).It has a slightly darker twist on the colour scheme and prefers "Open Sans"-style fonts.
